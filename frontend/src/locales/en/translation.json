After that, we will send the results and recommendations via email and discuss them in 1-3 online meetings. If the student is not satisfied with the options provided, we will arrange a follow-up meeting to make substitutions."

The student then proceeds to work on the essay, with weekly Zoom meetings to monitor progress, make suggestions, and propose improvements. When the essay is finished, it is sent to the editor, who makes the final retouches. The process takes about 4 weeks, but it is possible to shorten it.
